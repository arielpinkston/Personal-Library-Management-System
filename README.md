This Java program is a text-based book catalog system that allows users to manage a personal library. Users can add books with details like title, author, genre, and borrower, then list, sort, or remove entries. Books can be filtered by genre or borrower and sorted alphabetically by the author's last name. The program also supports saving the catalog to a file and reading it back later.
